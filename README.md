# SEC10K
Tech stacks: I used Python for the backend. I first downloaded the data using the SEC Edgar Downloader import. Then, I cleaned the data using regex (to isolate sections I wanted), and used a ChatGPT API to perform inference on the data. I then used HTML/CSS/JavaScript to create the frontend. I was not able to get the Flask connection fully working, but aside from that, the project is finished. I will upload an image to Github showing the completed text analysis portion.

Insights: 
I first looked for risk factors. Users would care about this insight because it directly impacts their willingness to buy or sell certain companies' stocks (depending on how much risk they are willing to take on).
I also looked for stockholder information. Users would care about this because knowing the amount of shares of a certain company are sold, or which markets the company trades on, is useful information to make a personal investment decision.
I finally looked for general business information. This includes what the company is about, how they make money, etc. This is useful to get a sense of what the company is doing, and a user can then decide how valuable they think the company is.
